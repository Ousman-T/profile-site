        <h1>Bio Page</h1>
        <p>On January 14th, 2023, I made my first commit to GitHub! However, my lack of experience is balanced out by my sheer work ethic. I can confidently say that I've put myself in the position I'm currently in from sheer determination and work. There are many things that I must master and get more familiar with. However, nothing is unachievable in my eyes with the right level of attention!</p>

            <h3 class="h3">Personal Hobbies</h3>
            <p>Although CODING IS LIFE, I also have hobbies outside of programming (however few they are)</p>
            <ol class="bio-ol">
                <li>Gaming</li>
                <li>Skateboarding</li>
                <li>Listening to Lectures</li>
                <li>Reading</li>
                <li>Spending Times With Friends</li>
                <li><strong>LEARNING</strong></li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>I placed emphasis on learning because learning is foundational for all of my hobbies. Quite frankly, it isn't a hobby to me if I can't learn from it, or improve on it. Which is why skateboarding was my first love! Skating taught me persistence, which I utilize in all aspects of my life. The simple task of learning to perform an Ollie, takes literal dedication, hard work, and patience. Same with gaming (however, I only play extremely difficult games, think Rouge-Likes, Souls-Bourne, or Zelda for problem solving). I fall asleep listening to lectures almost daily. And if it isn't a lecture? Best believe I fell asleep watching a video on ancient history, or a documentary about a past leader.</p>
